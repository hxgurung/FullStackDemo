Executive Summary

The Travlr application has three main parts which are index, user and travel files. The view files contains the files which are used to view the websites by the end users. The handlerbars are used to format the application page to format the code by using hbs tags instead of hard coding the same code in every page. The controllers does the input and send the results as required. 

MEAN stack is used for the development of this application with the combination of Angular.js, express.js and MongoDB. The application used MEAN methodology where MongoDB is the database, Express is the webserver , Angular is used for front end and the Node is being used as the backend for the application. It is highly depended on internet connection and may cause loss or corruption of data if the internet connection is not stable. MVC routing is highly used to integrate all the parts handlebars allowed to reuse and format the code.


Design Constraints

In terms of MEAN stack, it is better for developing large scale applications where frequents updates are pushed. The major design constraints would be the financial issues with this project. Considering the financial cost , we wont be able to get best developers to work with and also time will be a great constraint. The project may not be properly tested if we lack enough developers to test the code for the application. These all issues revolves around the financial constraints. The other constraints are minimal with this application, MongoDB is widely used for storing data in cloud.

API Endpoints

<Exposing RESTful endpoints is a design approach to enable an application to participate in a larger ecosystem. Document each endpoint in the table below, including the HTTP method, purpose, URL, and notes.>

Method	Purpose	URL	Notes
GET	Retrieve all the list of trips	<api/trips>	Retrieves a list of all trips in the database.
GET	Retrieve a particular detailstrip	api/trips/:tripsId	Return the particular trip details from the database


Angular and Express are both frameworks used for web development, but they serve different purposes and have different project structures. Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) while Express is a back-end framework for building web applications and APIs. 
Angular project structure usually includes a directory for components, services, modules, and assets. The components handle the presentation logic and interact with the services, which handle the business logic. Express projects typically have a simpler structure, with a main server file that sets up the server and routes, and a public directory for serving static assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
In summary, the Angular project structure is more complex and organized than the Express HTML customer-facing page structure, reflecting the different purposes and capabilities of these two frameworks. 
To test the functionality of SPA and all the REST APIs can be done by creating a local testing environment which is the local host server. First step would be ensuring the application compiles perfectly and we can also add console.log to debug the issues and also utilize dev tools and google chrome resources.
The process of testing an Angular SPA to ensure that it is working with an API to GET and PUT data in the database involves creating a separate testing environment, writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, running the tests, and fixing any issues that are identified. Studio3t can be used to verify the APIs are updating the data in database and the Postman can assist to test these APIs.
